README FOR DOMAIN_IDENTIFIER (January 19 of 2009)


Domain identifier is a program runing on MPI to compute the domain of
dark matter FOF halos identified in simulations. The domains are
defined as the set of particles that are nearest to a halo than to
other halos, when using distances weighted by the virial radius of the
halos. That is, a particle located at distance d(i) belongs to a halo
of virial radius Rvir(i) if d(i)/Rvir(i) is the minimum quantity when
computed across the overal set of halos.

The results are stored in a binary table, in wich the label of the
halo for every particle is stored.

The results of this program are needed for Densfield, who reads the
table and computes the Delaunay volumes of the particle distribution
and then build the density field of a populations of halos.
