THIS CODE COMPUTES THE DLEAUNAY TESELLATION AND ASSOCIATED VORONOY VOLUMES OF
PARTICLES IN A BOX. IT USES PERIODIC BOUNDARY CONDITIONS TO TREAT THE BORDERS
OF THE BOX, AND PRODUCES A BUNCH OF FILES FROM EVERY PROCCESSOR, THAT HAS TO
BE POST PROCESSED.

DELAUNAY TESSELLATION IS COMPUTED USING QHULL (qdelaunay) AND RUNS IN
PARAALLEL USING Nprocs=x^3, THAT MEANS THAT THE NUMBER OF PROCESSES HAS TU BE
A PERFECT CUBE.

RESULTS CAN BE USED TO COMPUTE THE DENSITY DISTRIBUTION OF MATTER IN DOMAINS,
OR SOMETHING ELSE.
